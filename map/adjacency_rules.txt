# Adjacency rules determine if an army, navy or trade can pass through the adjacency (e.g. a canal or strait).
#
# If two countries at war control provinces in the adjacency it is considered contested.
# The optional triggers is_enemy, is_friend and is_neutral are evaluated in order and if one evaluates to true the corresponding rule is used.
# If is_enemy and is_friend evaluates to false the neutral rule is used. In this case the is_neutral trigger will not be evaluated at all.
# If is_friend and is_neutral evaluates to false the enemy rule is used.
# If is_enemy and is_neutral evaluates to false the friend rule is used.
# If any adjacency province controller is at war with the country the enemy rule is used, unless is_enemy evaluates to false, then the neutral rule is used.
# If any adjacency province controller is an ally of is giving military access to the country the friend rule is used, unless is_friend evaluates to false, then the neutral rule is used.
# Otherwise the neutral rule is used, unless is_neutral evaluates to false, then the enemy rule is used.
#
# The 'name' property is how you refer to the rule in adjacencies.csv
